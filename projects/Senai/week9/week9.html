    <h1>Week 9 – Senai Web Development Course</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This page contains all the React-based development activities completed in Week 9 of the Senai Web Development course. The focus of this week is on creating a functional daily task manager and implementing core features such as state management, conditional rendering, persistence, and user interaction.</p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>✅ Task 1: Task Manager – Add New Task</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> We are building a daily task manager. Each task must include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A description field;</li>
        <li>A time period selector (Morning / Afternoon / Evening);</li>
        <li>A completed status (checkbox).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Create a component that allows users to add a new task by filling in the description, selecting the period, and clicking an "Add" button. The new task should be added to the task array in the main component.</p>

      <h3>✅ Task 2: Task Manager – Display Tasks</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Display the list of tasks in three separate columns based on their period (Morning, Afternoon, Evening). This should appear below the task addition form.</p>
      <p>Also, show the total number of completed tasks.</p>

      <h3>✅ Task 3: Task Manager – Mark as Completed</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Each task item should include a checkbox to mark it as completed. When a task is marked as completed, its description should appear in light gray and be strikethrough.</p>

      <h3>✅ Task 4: Task Manager – Progress Bar</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Create a component that displays the percentage of tasks completed. This component should receive at least two props: the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.</p>
      <p><code>const progress = (completedTasks / totalTasks) * 100</code></p>

      <h3>✅ Task 5: Task Manager – Data Persistence</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Implement data persistence using <code>localStorage</code>. Any task added or updated should be stored. When the app loads, check <code>localStorage</code> for existing tasks and load them into state.</p>
      <p><em>Tip:</em> Use <code>useEffect</code> to synchronize the task list with localStorage.</p>

      <h3>✅ Task 6: Stopwatch Challenge</h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Deliver a stopwatch project that was developed in class during Week 9 (Session 2). The activity was assigned during the session and had a fixed time for development.</p>
      <p>Submission must be made via GitHub link according to instructions given during class.</p>
